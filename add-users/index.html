    <p>User management is designated to the “Developer” role only and can be accessed at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/admin/people</code></p>

<h2 id="user-fields">User Fields</h2>

<p>A user should be given at the minimum a username and a password, and can also be designated with an email</p>

<p>The Site language should be set to the default language in which the user will publish content, and the timezone should be set to the user’s timezone.</p>

<h2 id="user-roles">User Roles</h2>

<p>There are three roles that are active on the site:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Developer</strong>: This role has access to all site settings and actions. It is a high-level privilege and should only be given to highly-trusted individuals. Because it has the ability to set the site domain and unpublish/delete a country team, this role is capable of taking a site offline.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Content Editor</strong>: This role is for site admins who are to have all control over content on the site. They can:
    <ul>
      <li>create, edit, delete and publish content</li>
      <li>manually sync content (SDGs and Contacts)</li>
      <li>edit most Country Team settings and set featured and homepage content</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Content Creator</strong>: This role is for writers of content. They can create and edit their own content and save as drafts (but not publish).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adding-a-user-to-a-country-team">Adding a User to a Country Team</h2>

<p>In order to work with content for a particular country team, a user needs to be added to that team. A user can be part of one or more country teams. Users with the “developer” role have default access to all groups.</p>

<p>Group membership to the country team is controlled on the “Group” tab on the Country Team admin page.</p>

<p>From the Group tab, click on “Members”, then “Add Members” and add users to the country team group using the dialogue.</p>

<p>Users do not need to have a role in the group to be able to view and edit content for the country team.</p>
