The following site settings are available only to developers as they can impact critical functions of the site.

**DOMAIN**: This should be set to the domain of the live site (e.g. turkemenistan.un.org)

**COUNTRY CODE (ISO2 CODE)**: The ISO2 code that controls which data is pulled in from external APIs.

**COUNTRY CODE (ISO3 CODE)**: The ISO3 code that controls which data is pulled in from external APIs.

**COUNTRY DEFAULT LANGUAGE**: The default language for the site and the language in which content will originally be published. All translated content must have a default language original. *Changing a site's default language after the creation of content can have unpredicted consequences.*

A developer can also unpublish the country team which will have the effect of unpublishing the country site.
